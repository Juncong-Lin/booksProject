# Placeholder Book Image Documentation

## 📚 Purpose
This directory contains placeholder images used as fallbacks when book cover images fail to load.

## 🎯 Current Implementation
- **File**: `placeholder-book.svg` 
- **Usage**: Fallback image in `scripts/shared/image-loader.js`
- **Dimensions**: 200x300 pixels (standard book cover ratio)
- **Format**: SVG (scalable, lightweight)

## 🛠️ Implementation Details
The placeholder is automatically used by the ImageLoader utility when:
1. Primary book cover image fails to load
2. Image URL is invalid or broken
3. Network issues prevent image loading

## 🎨 Visual Design
- Clean, minimalist book icon
- Neutral gray color scheme
- "Book Cover Not Available" text
- Professional appearance that matches site design

## ✅ Status: IMPLEMENTED
The placeholder system is now fully functional and integrated into the website's image loading system.
