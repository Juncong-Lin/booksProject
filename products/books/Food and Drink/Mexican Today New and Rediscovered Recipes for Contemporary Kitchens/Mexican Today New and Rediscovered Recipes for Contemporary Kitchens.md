In Mexican Today, she shares easy, generous dishes, both traditional ones and her own new spins. Some are regional recipes she has recovered from the past and updated, like Miners’ Enchiladas with fresh vegetables and cheese or Drunken Rice with Chicken and Chorizo, a specialty of the Yucatán. “Sweaty” Tacos with ripe tomatoes and cheese are so convenient they’re sold on Mexican streets by bicyclists. Her grandmother’s Cornflake Cookies feel just as contemporary now as they did then.  Pati has “Mexed up” other recipes in such family favorites as Mexican Pizza with Grilled Skirt Steak and Onions.

This food will draw everyone together—a family at the end of a working day, a book club, or a neighborhood potluck.  Throughout, Pati is an infectious cheerleader, sharing stores of the food, people, and places behind the recipes. ...more
